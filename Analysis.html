                        José Rizal's "The Philippines a Century Hence" (Filipinas Dentro de Cien Años) is a four-part essay 
                        published in La Solidaridad from 1889 to 1890. It is a profound analysis of Spanish colonial rule in 
                        the Philippines, its effects on Filipino society, and predictions about the nation's future. The essay 
                        remains an essential text in understanding colonialism and its lasting consequences.

                    <h2>Education as Liberation</h2>
                    <div class="book-description">
                        Rizal emphasized education as the most important tool for progress, maintaining an educated people can engage 
                        critically in the governance. Rizal anticipated education would awaken Filipinos to their potential and rights.
                        Denial of access to good education ensures continuation of poverty traps. Rizal's appeal for the use of education 
                        as a source of critical analysis and socioeconomic progress is vital for country's growth.
                        A well-educated society is more able to insist on accountability and openness from leaders. 
                        Inequities in access to education (e.g., urban-rural, rich-poor) further widen social 
                        divisions.

                    <div class="book-description">
                        He emphasizes promoting a unique Filipino identity, calling for unity from varied regions and cultures. 
                        Rizal seeks of a nation united through common history and goals, independent of colonial oppression.
                        Strong Filipino identity might promote a people-oriented policy focus on 
                        balanced development. A collective identity may energize common action against corruption and 
                        self-interested elites.

                    <h2>Youth Empowerment</h2>
                    <div class="book-description">
                        Rizal considered the youth as the hope of the nation, encouraging their education and morals to guide the 
                        country towards development. Equipping the youth with skills, 
                        entrepreneurial minds, and political voice can awaken their potential to be economic drivers. 
                        Young Filipinos are underrepresented in decision-making but experience the impact of systemic corruption. 
                        Involving youth in the government creates new ideas and 
                        honor. Rizal's faith in young 
                        people as change-makers higlights the imperative of inclusive policy making where everyone gets a chance 
                        to speak.

                        <ul>• He argued that colonial rule created a cycle of poverty, injustice, and resistance among Filipinos.</ul>
                        <ul>• He warned that if Spain continued its abuses and failed to implement reforms, Filipinos would eventually seek independence through revolution.</ul>

                        <ul>• Rizal’s essay serves as a case study of how colonial rule can suppress a nation’s development and provoke resistance.</ul>
                        <ul>• He emphasized that colonialism’s effects persist long after foreign rule ends, influencing a nation’s economy, culture, and governance.</ul>
                        <ul>• His insights apply not only to the Philippines but also to other colonies that struggled under imperial rule.</ul>

                        <ul>• The Philippines’ history under Spanish rule shares similarities with the struggles of Latin American countries, India under British rule, and African nations under European colonization.</ul>
                        <ul>• Like in the Philippines, many colonized societies faced cultural erasure, economic exploitation, and eventual nationalist movements leading to independence</ul>
                        <ul>• Rizal’s work helps modern readers understand how colonialism shaped societies globally and why its effects are still visible today.</ul>
